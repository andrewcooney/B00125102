<div class="mediatext">One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a
private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few

examples are as following:<br><br>
    
    
<div class="mediatext">1. Science<br><br>
    
Students can take photos or videos of experiments that they are doing in school and post on
Instagram, from there they could all comment on each others posts and examine each
    others results and differences. Teachers can also join and give critical feedback</div><br><br>
    
<div class="mediatext">2. Art<br><br>

Students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects in art class.
This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also
lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following
    which will be useful in the future.</div><br><br>

Similar to Art, students can post short clips of themselves playing an instrument or singing.
They can also make small tutorials for fellow classmates that might want to learn an
instrument. They could also post and ask followers for opinions on a cover of a song or an
    original.</div>
